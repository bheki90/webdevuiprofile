                <h2>About</h2>
                <h3>Get to know me</h3>
                <p>Growing up I have always been interested in the tech 
                    world, whether it be through gaming, graphic design 
                    or social media. This world has always been one of my 
                    greatest interests. I was first introduced to html and css in college. 
                    Back then I did not know much about front-end development, 
                    it was only after stumblling upon a Youtube video titled 
                    'Day in the life of a Netflix web developer'. 
                    that was when I started doing my own research. 
                    I found amazing books that taught me all about javascript programming. 
                    After that I knew I had to learn a framework for me to be job ready, so I went 
                    back to youtube and one of the developers I found shared 
                    his story on how he taught himself React and got a job in Silicon Valey.</p>
                <p>I thought that was great so I clicked the link to the course he recommended. What was so great about 
                    this course is that it took you from an absolute beginner with React, to building your own ecommerce 
                    web application. I wasn't easy but Pushed through and even to this I still try learn new things about 
                    React and other frameworks that might be desired by potential employers and clients.</p>
                <p>One thing about me is that learning new technologies is a huge passion of mine. It doesn't matter how
                     challenging or time consuming it may be once I started I wont stop until I master it.</p>
